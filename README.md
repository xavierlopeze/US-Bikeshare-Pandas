# Explore US Bikeshare Data using Python

### Description
This project consists on developing a python program that is able to read data from US Bikeshares in the form of .csv files and compute some basic analytical statistics.

The goal of this project has been to get familiar with the basic syntax of pandas and git.

### Files used
In order to run this program a simple execution of the file bikeshare.py is sufficient

```console
ipython bikeshare.py
```

Note that it is required to have the following .csv files in the same folder as bikeshare.py:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv


### Credits
Many posts from https://stackexchange.com/ have been used during the development.
